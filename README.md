MulDiLoC-HAP Corpus Description
MulDiLoC-HAP (Multidialectal, Longitudinal Corpus of Human–AI Hybrid Production) is a large-scale corpus collected to investigate linguistic diversity, dialectal variation, and socio-cognitive dynamics in human–LLM hybrid language production.
The MulDiLoC-HAP corpus was built through a series of controlled experiments conducted with human participants and large language models. The design captures both natural and AI-assisted writing across five major English varieties: British, American, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand English.
Core Experimental Design
Participants completed three writing tasks:
1.	Natural Writing Task: Participants wrote a 500-word informal essay on a given topic (e.g., work–life balance) without any assistance.
2.	Machine-Assisted Writing Task: Participants wrote another 500-word essay under one of three LLM-assisted conditions:
o	Grammar and style feedback
o	Incremental suggestions
o	First-half continuation (participants completed an AI-generated opening draft)
3.	Delayed Posttest (Three Weeks Later): Participants wrote a new essay without assistance to examine persistence and transfer effects of AI-assisted writing.
